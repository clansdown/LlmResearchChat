# Dependency Fix Summary

## Changes Made:

1. **Removed deprecated electron-spellchecker** - This package is no longer needed as modern Electron has built-in spellcheck support
2. **Updated dependencies to latest versions:**
   - axios: ^1.6.5 → ^1.7.2
   - electron-store: ^8.1.0 → ^8.2.0
   - electron-log: ^5.0.3 → ^5.1.2
   - electron-updater: ^6.1.7 → ^6.1.8

3. **Cleaned up node_modules and package-lock.json** for fresh install

## Result:
- All dependencies installed successfully with no errors
- The app now uses Electron's built-in spellcheck feature (already configured in main.js with `spellcheck: true`)
- No code changes were needed as the app was already using the built-in spellcheck

## Note:
The spellcheck functionality is handled by:
- In main.js: `spellcheck: true` in BrowserWindow webPreferences
- In renderer.js: `spellcheck="true"` attribute on the message input element
