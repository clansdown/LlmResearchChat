Create a packageable electron application installable on linux that presents an AI chat interface aimed at doing research. It should use the openrouter.ai API for the AI queries. It should present a chat interface in which the user can ask a question and get an answer, with the words of the answer streaming into the window and the ability to press a stop button to stop getting aditional words of the answer. the user should be able to edit what they said and try again. The interface should highlight potentially misspelled words before the query starts. Each conversation should be saved to a file on disk and the history should be browsable, and the user should be able to continue the conversation from the browsable history. It should be possible to launch links that are provided in the browser and to highlight text and press a button to search for it in the browser with the search engine of the user's choice (configurable in settings). There should be a settings page which is accessible in which the user enters their API credentials for the queries, chooses their preferred search engine (which must include kagi), and can edit a system prompt which is text that is automatically appended to a query. The user should be able to enter multiple, marking one of them as the default. the interface should allow the user to choose between their predefined system prompts. it should be configurable whether the system prompt is sent once or appended to everything the user says.
